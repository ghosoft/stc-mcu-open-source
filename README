I'm using exclusively Linux on my machines since around 2004 without
any regret - all the opposite! We also made the switch at work 2-3 
years ago because it makes a developer's life so much easier!

However, from time to time, I still come across vendors who aren't 
aware of the importance of Linux, and of the benefits of open source 
in commercial activities.

As it's apparently the case with STC, I decided to document and share 
my findings in order to make it easy for anyone to enjoy using their 
MCU with open source tools.

A PDF version of my document is provided so that you can preview it 
directly in you browser, instead of having to launch an office suite.

1. Add the console-stcXX.c file matching your MCU, and console-stdio.c
to your Makefile.

2. In the C source file implementing main(), include the console-stcXX.h 
file matching your MCU and call console_initialise(YOUR_BAUD_RATE).

3. Before using console I/O, make sure interrupts are enabled.

4. console-stdio.c redirects putchar() and getchar() to the console, so 
you can just use functions defined in stdio.h for console I/O.

5. On your PC, I recommend you use Minicom as terminal emulator, as 
it's available on all the OS I've tested, so you won't need to get 
used to a different tools when switching to another OS. 

The command line is as easy as:

minicom -b YOUR_BAUD_RATE -D /dev/YOUR_SERIAL_PORT

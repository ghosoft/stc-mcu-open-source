1. Add the delay-stcXX.c file matching your MCU to your Makefile.

2. Include delay.h when you need tu use delays.

NOTE: delay.h provides 2 functions, one for delays in milliseconds, and 
another for delays in tens of microseconds.

Shorter delays cannot be reliably obtained in a uniform way across the 
whole STC MCU product range. 

If you need delays in microseconds, you'll have to implement a delay 
loop specific to your use case.

delay1us.h and delay1us-stc8.c illustrate such an option.

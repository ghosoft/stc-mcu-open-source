Here are 2 Makefile examples I use in my projects, one for single-DPTR 
MCU, and the other for dual-DPTR MCU.

I included the crtxinit.asm file provided by SDCC to illustrate how to 
modify it for dual-DPTR support.

Finally, I also added the doxygen.conf I use in my projects in case 
you'd like to use the same configuration for yours.

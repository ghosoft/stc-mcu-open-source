generate-header is a Ruby command line utility generating a header for 
an MCS-51 MCU from a CSV definition file. I created it to be able to 
use SDCC - headers provided by STC are only compatible with Keil.

The generated header contains register and bit definitions as well as 
interrupt vectors, bank switching functions and a few useful macros 
(e.g. F_CPU).

Usage: ./generate-header STC8AF.csv stc8af.h

It comes with a few CSV file examples for the STC8A, STC8F, STC8G, 
STC8H, STC15, STC16, STC12 and STC90 MCU families.

These files were manually created using information from the STC
reference manuals of the respective MCU families.

The CSV files are covered by the same copyright notice and license 
as the code (see the comment at the top of generate-header), i.e. 
the BSD-2-Clause license.

If present, the license.txt file will be included at the top of each 
generated header.

Note that there's nothing specific to STC in this code generator. You 
could use it for any other MCS-x51 MCU provided you create its CSV file.

IMPORTANT

- I had to change the names of a few bit masks to avoid conflicts, 
which may be the reason why STC's header files are incomplete.
So if you copy-paste an example and have an undefined symbol, just 
check its non-conflicting name in the header file.

- I also had to alias the SFR used to control DTPR selection on 
dual-DPTR MCU, because SDCC always expects a _DPS global symbol 
for that SFR, regardless of the name chosen by the manufacturer.
